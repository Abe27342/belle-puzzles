# Belle Bot

TODO

TODO: Implement channel deletion -> puzzle deletion (but not google sheed, that feels too aggressive)
TODO: Implement way for SWA to poke the discord bot if it makes any edits and the bot has already closed the file.
TODO: Log file close for that note. Or better telemetry.
TODO: Show error messages in a channel for the server?
