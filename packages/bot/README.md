TODO: Better telemetry story.
TODO: Show error messages in a channel for the server?

TODO: Make sense of layering in this package. Right now it's set up to use a project build with tsc because
without it build times are ~3x slower due to large number of file imports from google APIs. But there are
probably more gains to be had in the realm with more sensible layering and package structure.

TODO: consider using [forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever)
